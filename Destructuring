What does destructuring do exactly. When would you use it

Ans: Destructing means it is a javascript expression that is used to extract data from arrays, objects and any other. That is it extract data from array and objects and set or store that data elements into new variables.
      When we destruct data from array we can use any distinct variables but, if we extract data from objects we have to use variables as properties in objects that is key's name.


// OUTPUT

1)
const obj1 = {'key1': 1, "key2": 2, "key3": 1000}
const { key1, key3} = { ...obj1}
console.log(key1, key3)
//Output: 1,1000

2)
const arr1 = ['value1', 'value2']
const [ val1, val2 ] = arr1
console.log(val1)
console.log(val2)
//Output: value1
          value2

3)
const obj1 = {'key1': 1, "key2": 2, "key3": 1000}
let { key1, key3} = obj1
key1 = 20;
key3 = 123
console.log(obj1.key1, obj1.key3)
//Output: 1,1000
